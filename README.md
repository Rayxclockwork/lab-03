## About ME!
Project for Code 201 to let others learn about me while allowing me to practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've created a guessing game so when user first enters site, it prompts them with questions about me for user to make guesses.

### Reflection

Day 1 (9/10/19):
- Added all the files need like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Added layout and the first 5 prompt questions.
- Ran pretty smoothly except for the margins for the page but figured it out the next day

Day 2 (9/11/19):

How did this go, overall?
It was pretty tricky for me. I knew for Question 6 I needed to make a for loop and how to write the prompt. But it was tricky for me to make prompt show the correct answers once the user ran out of attempts.

What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
When I think I have it, I feel like I struggle applying what I've learned. I get it eventually but it's a slow process.

How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
It took me 9 hrs. I thought it'd take me 6 hrs at most.

Day 3 (9/12/19):

Raven Delaney was the driver for today's pair programming.
