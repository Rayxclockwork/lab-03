## About ME!
Project for Code 201 to let others learn about me while allowing me to practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**Author:** Shelby Byrd

**Reflection**
Day 1:
- Added all the files need like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Added layout and the first 5 prompt questions.
- Ran pretty smoothly except for the margins for the page but figured it out the next day

Day 2:
- Added Question 6 (about number of cousins) and Question 7 (about my favorite singers)
- This was challenging for me a took me way longer than it should've.
